Fuyunghai, or in Mandarin *furongdan*, meaning "hibiscus flower egg," is a traditional Chinese dish from Shanghai. Some also say that *Fu yong hai* translates to "Fu yung egg slices," which refers to the original recipe from Shanghai locals. This dish is an omelet filled with a mix of vegetables and meat, originally created from leftover ingredients due to a vegetable shortage at the time. Although it originated in China, Fuyunghai is more popular in Indonesia, England, and America than in its home country.
