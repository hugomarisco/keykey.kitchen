  **Tips:**


  * Frying: Use low heat to ensure the meat cooks evenly. High heat may cause the coating to burn while the inside remains undercooked.

  * Sauce Preparation: Keep stirring the sauce over low heat to prevent burning and achieve a smooth texture.


  *Pair this Tonkatsu with warm rice or a fresh salad for a complete and satisfying meal. The crispy texture of the meat combined with the rich and savory sauce makes every bite truly tastilicious!*

Tonkatsu is a beloved Japanese dish known for its crispy coating and juicy meat. However, this recipe takes inspiration from the Korean variation, where the meat is pounded thin before frying, resulting in a softer texture and extra crispiness. This easy-to-follow recipe is perfect for serving as a main dish at home.
